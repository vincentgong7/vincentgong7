## Hello World.
### I'm a bit late.
Using social media data, such as Twitter and Instagram, I identify relevant information, develop data models, estimate and analyse crowdsâ€™ characteristics in city events, including demographic and city-role composition, Spatial-temporal distribution, sentiment estimation, Points of Interest preferences, word use, crowd size and density estimation, which help crowd managers make better decisions.
